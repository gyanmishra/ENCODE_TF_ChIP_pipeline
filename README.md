# ENCODE TF ChIP pipeline using SPP and MACS2 for peak calling, and IDR for consistency analysis

Includes two major scripts:

1) install_software.sh - if the VM is new will install the needed software for analysis minus the genome index

2) run.sh - main pipeline for alignments, peak calling, and IDR analysis.
